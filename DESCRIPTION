Description: This is a R-package for carrying out multiple-omics data integration using networks,
    in a systems biology approach. The tool integrates up to three types of -omics data using 
    networks as input to create co-expression scores. Then using a supervised approach, it 
    identifies a set of subnetwork signatures that best discriminate between phenotypic outcomes.
    If there is no known network, the tool includes a network inference module that estimates 
    a partial correlation network. The package also includes additional functionalities such as
    a prediction module for classifying samples based on identified signatures.
